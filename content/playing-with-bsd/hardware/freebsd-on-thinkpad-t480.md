I've been using FreeBSD as my primary server OS for quite a long time.  
But, for unknown reasons, I have never seriously used it on client workstations.

Maybe it's partly because I'm a CUI-oriented person who loves doing things on text terminals as much as possible.

Actually, I have been pretty happy with any client OS as long as I could use a decent terminal on it, so that I could SSH into FreeBSD servers where I spent a lot of time doing jobs which didn't require graphical interface.

However, it's also true that I have been wishing for a FreeBSD desktop which allows me to do everything from web browsing to text editing on a single machine.

So I started a reseach on FreeBSD laptops in the midst of this year's longer-than-usual rainy season. After gathering information on the web, I tried various GUI setup on VMs and then I bought a new laptop, Lenovo ThinkPad T480.

Experimenting a bit more on the T480, finally I've got a fully working FreeBSD laptop for daily use, just after the rainy season was over!

Because it proved to be a really great machine for running FreeBSD, I wrote this article to share my experience with anyone who looks for a similar one.

## Laptop Specs
Generally speaking, I love small machines with lower power consumption. But this time, my goal is replacing my main desktop (running Windows) with a new laptop, so I invested on performance much more than usual.

- CPU: Core i7-8550U 1.8GHz (Boosted to 4.0GHz) (4 cores/8 threads, TDP 15W)
- RAM: 32GB (16GBx2) DDR4 2400MHz SODIMM
- Storage: SAMSUNG 860 EVO 1.0TB SATA SSD
  (originally the laptop came with a SEAGATE STL1000LM035 1.0TB (5400rpm) SATA)
- VGA: Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620
- Ethernet: Onboard 1000BASE-T
- WiFi: Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 (2x2 AC) + BT 4.1
- No Fingerprint and Smartcard readers

## What works and what does not
With FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE + Xorg + XFCE4, I can get the following stuff working on T480.

- Ethernet and WiFi work, although WiFi is a bit slow (only up to 802.11a?) compared to 802.11n/802.11ac capable OSes.
- Xorg works fine in full resolution (1920x1080) with i915kms.ko.
- Suspend/resume works almost fine as the same level as Windows (they sometimes get weird anyway).
- Sound output works.
- Microphone seems to work on Audacity and Google Hangouts.
- Mute button works. Volume buttons do not work but you can adjust volume with UI.
- LCD Brightness buttons work.
- SD card reader seems to work. DOS-formatted SD card can be mounted and read as usual filesystems. 
- Some Windows programs can be run on WINE.
- Windows 10 can be run on bhyve.

I haven't able to make those things work so far.

- Webcam works on pwcview with webcamd and cuse.ko but isn't detected by Google Hangouts on Firefox/Chromium.
- Failover between Ethernet and WiFi in the following example (Example 31.3. Failover Mode Between Ethernet and Wireless Interfaces).  
<https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/network-aggregation.html>

I haven't tested the following items.

- Bluetooth (disabled in BIOS to avoid hang on reboot)

## Initial Setup
### Disable Secure Boot, TPM and Bluetooth in BIOS Menu
To boot T480 from FreeBSD installation media, I had to enter the BIOS menu and disable Secure Boot and TPM.  
It is also required to disable Bluetooth to avoid hangup on system reboot.  
<https://wiki.freebsd.org/Laptops/Thinkpad_X270>

To enter the setup menu on startup, press Enter at the Lenovo logo screen.
A loud beep can be suppressed by turn Mute button on.  
<https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-11e-Windows-13-E-and/Loud-Beep-entering-bios-selecting-bootdevice-annoyance/td-p/2041295>

To enter the BIOS setup from the menu, press F1.  
Change the following settings and press F10 to save and exit.

- Security > Secure Boot
  + Secure Boot: Enabled -> Disabled
- Security > Security Chip
  + Security Chip: Enabled -> Disabled
- Security > I/O Port Access
  + Bluetooth: Enabled -> Disabled

It looks like the memstick installer supports UEFI boot so I left "Startup" page's "UEFI/Legacy Boot" and "CSM Support" untouched ("UEFI Only" and "NO" respectively).

### Which Version to Install?
At first, I selected the following FreeBSD versions as candidates.

- FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE
- FreeBSD 12-STABLE
- FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE

With experts' advices on Twitter and experiments on actual machine with installation media and RAM disk, I chose 12.0-RELEASE to start with. Now it turns out to be the right choice based on the right advices.

### OS Installation
There's almost nothing special about installation. But here's a few things to note.

- To boot from a USB stick (memstick.img), press Enter > F12 to enter the Boot Menu and select the USB HDD to boot.  

- For distribution sets, I selected 'kernel-dbg' and 'lib32' in addition to implicit 'base' and 'kernel' (lib32 for WINE).

- For filesystem, of course I chose ZFS. Specify "GPT (UEFI)" for partitioning scheme. I created a 4g swap partition mostly for crash dump space.

- I setup WiFi interface iwm0. 

- For system services, I enable moused, ntpd, powerd and disable sshd.

- I put my user account in secondary groups wheel, operator and video.

- Before exiting the installer, I manually renamed a ZFS dataset for home directories as usual.
```
rm /home
zfs rename zroot/usr/home zroot/home
zfs set mountpoint=/home zroot/home
exit
```

### Basic Configurations After the First Boot
After the first boot, I logged in and performed the following usual configurations.

- Update the OS.
```
su
freebsd-update fetch install
shutdown -r now
```

- Install basic packages.
I usually install non-X or lite versions if available but this time I selected full versions.
```
su
pkg update
pkg install git vim tmux bash sudo rsync perl5 ja-nkf zfs-stats portmaster gnupg1
```

- Configure sudoers.
```
visudo
```

- Configure user preferences such as dotfiles.

### Setting up Grahpical Desktop Environment
I'm completely new to the graphical desktop world. So it's inevitable for me to learn things one by one through a lot of trial and error.

Anyway, I use the following components to build my desktop.

- Xorg - Display Server
- SLiM - Login Manager
- Xfce - Desktop Environment

Plus, here is the list of applications for my daily use.

- Xfce4-Terminal - Terminal
- Firefox, Chromium - Web Browser
- Thunderbird - Mail Client
- Rhythmbox - Jukebox
- Audacity - Sound Editor
- Joplin - Note Taking Application (Evernote Alternative)
- Picasa3 (Windows Application) - Picture Organizer which runs on WINE.

Setup process was as follows.

- Install Graphics Driver and reboot the system.
```
sudo pkg install drm-kmod
sudo sysrc kld_list="/boot/modules/i915kms.ko"
shutdown -r now
```

- Install Xorg and releated packages.
```
sudo pkg install xorg xfce xfce4-goodies slim slim-themes firefox thunderbird chromium
```

- Install local language stuff
```
sudo pkg install japanese/font-std japanese/font-vlgothic japanese/font-takao ja-fcitx-mozc ja-fcitx-skk zh-fcitx-configtool
```

- Create ~/.xinitrc.  
There are a lot of language configurations. Please ignore them if you do not need them.
```
#!/bin/sh
#
# ~/.xinitrc for Xfce4
#
## Locale
export LC_ALL=ja_JP.UTF-8
export LANGUAGE=ja_JP.UTF-8
export LANG=ja_JP.UTF-8

## Input Method - fcitx-mozc
export GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
export QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx
export XMODIFIERS='@im=fcitx'

## Start Input Method
/usr/local/bin/mozc start
fcitx -r -d

## Disable Beep
xset -b

## Start Xfce4
exec startxfce4
```

- Configure and start services. This brings up a graphical login manager.
```
sudo sysrc dbus_enable=YES
sudo sysrc hald_enable=YES
sudo sysrc polkitd_enable=YES
sudo sysrc avahi_daemon_enable=YES
sudo sysrcÂ avahi_dnsconfd_enable=YES
sudo sysrc slim_enable=YES
sudo service dbus start
sudo service hald start
sudo service avahi-daemon start
sudo service avahi-dnsconfd start
sudo service slim start
```

## Personal Tips for Customization
### Shorter Boot Time
- Add the following line to /boot/loader.conf
```
autoboot_delay="2"
```

### Trackpoint and Touchpad
- Disable touchpad and enable "Virtual Scrolling" with the middle button.  
<https://ben-rowan.github.io/post/disable_lenovo_trackpad/>  
[/boot/loader.conf]  
```
hw.psm.synaptics_support="1"
```
[/etc/sysctl.conf]
```
hw.psm.synaptics.min_pressure=220
```
[/etc/rc.conf]
```
moused_flags="-V"
```

### Screen Brightness
- The following configurations along with XFCE4's Power Management allows me to automatically change brightness upon change of the power source (AC or battery).  
[/boot/loader.conf]
```
acpi_video_load="YES"
```
[/etc/sysctl.conf]
```
hw.acpi.video.lcd0.economy=30
hw.acpi.video.lcd0.fullpower=60
```

### SLiM
- Edit /usr/local/etc/slim.conf
```
default_user genneko
current_theme lake
```

### Audacity
- To export MP3, install lame from ports. Audacity itself can be installed via binary package.

### Joplin
- See [this article](/playing-with-bsd/application/joplin-on-freebsd).

### Beep on Logout
- When unmute, opening the logout dialog makes a loud beep. I added the following line to ~/.xinitrc to avoid it.
```
xset -b
```

### Printing to EPSON Ink-Jet Printer EP-802A
- Install and configure CUPS as follows. Then point your web browser to localhost:631 and configure the printer.
```
sudo pkg install gutenprint
sudo sysrc cupsd_enable=YES
sudo service cupsd start
```

-  xfce4-print package doesn't seem to support CUPS (only supports LPD).

### Pulling From OneDrive
- On the previous main PC (Windows 10), I used OneDrive to import photos taken by smartphones. OneDrive Free Client allows me to achieve this on FreeBSD machine.
```
sudo zfs create -o mountpoint=/data zroot/data
sudo zfs create -o recordsize=1M zroot/data/OneDrive
sudo chown genneko:genneko /data/OneDrive
sudo pkg install onedrive
onedrive
# Open the URL shown and sign in with your Microsoft account.  
# When you see a blank page after granting access to "OneDrive Free Client", enter the blank page's URL on the command-line prompt.
cat > .config/onedrive/config 
sync_dir = "/data/OneDrive"
^D
# Test it now.
onedrive --download-only --dry-run --synchronize
# Real Run.
onedrive --download-only --synchronize
```

### WINE
<https://wiki.winehq.org/FreeBSD>  
<https://wiki.freebsd.org/i386-Wine>  
<https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/wine-wow64-and-winetricks-at-x64-wine.62634/>  

- Install i386-wine-\* (this time I chose 'devel').
```
sudo pkg install i386-wine-devel wine-gecko-devel wine-mono-devel winetricks
```

- I can run IrfanView, Picasa3 and Yamaha's Mid Radio Player.

### Bhyve
Maybe in another post.
